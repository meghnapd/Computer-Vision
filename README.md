# Computer-Vision
We will implement AlexNet-like deep, convolutional neural network (CNN) with PyTorch. We are going to use the CNN to classify flowers into the 102 categories.

The Python file consists of the following parts:

Load and prepare data.
Load a pretrained Alexnet in PyTorch.
Set up transfer learning for flower classification problem
Train the model
Model performance monitoring and analysis with learning curve
